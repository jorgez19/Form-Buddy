A user inputed the following data for their form I-485 and I am to check it. Give me a list of any items that are very likely to be inccorrect. If there are any required fields that should be filled out, mention those. If there are any inconsistencies, mention those. Fields such as Pt1Line6_Gender[0]/Pt1Line6_Gender[1] are checkboxes so only one should be selected. This also pertains to fields ending in YN as those are \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" checkboxes. If it all looks good, simply reply "Form filled out Correctly! Only comment on fields that are incorrect. DO NOT give suggestions as I am not the one filling this out. I am simply checking if everything required it filled out correctly." :
