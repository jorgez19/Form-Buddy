Here is my input for the first 2 pages of form I-485. Tell me if i did it correctly and give me suggestions on anything that may be wrong or if I missed any required fields. Fields such as Pt1Line6_Gender[0]/Pt1Line6_Gender[1] are checkboxes so only one should be selected. This also pertains to fields ending in YN as those are \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" checkboxes. Also give suggestions to any fields that may be misspelled. Dates should be formatted mm/dd/yyyy. Do not give feedback on correctly answered fields :
